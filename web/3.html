    <h3>C</h3>
    <p>We are things of dry hours and the involuntary plan,<br>
    Grayed in, and gray. “Dream” makes a giddy sound, not strong<br>
    Like “rent,” “feeding a wife,” “satisfying a man.”</p>
    <p>But could a dream send up through onion fumes<br>
    Its white and violet, fight with fried potatoes<br>
    And yesterday’s garbage ripening in the hall,<br>
    <img src="coding.jpg.jpg" width="100%">
    Flutter, or sing an aria down these rooms</p>
    <p>Even if we were willing to let it in,<br>
    Had time to warm it, keep it very clean,<br>
    Anticipate a message, let it begin?</p>
    <p>We wonder. But not well! not for a minute!<br>
    Since Number Five is out of the bathroom now,<br>
    We think of lukewarm water, hope to get in it.</p>
